# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
A handwritten character recognition project involves developing a system or software that can automatically recognize and interpret handwritten characters in digital form. The goal of such a project is to accurately recognize characters from various sources, such as scanned documents or images, and convert them into machine-readable text.
